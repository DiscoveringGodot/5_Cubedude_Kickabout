# Discovering Godot - The Game Engine You've Been Waiting For

## Section 5 - CubeDude Kickabout

This is GameDev.tv's guide to the free and open source Godot game engine.  Learn the free to use, free to modify, free to create engine with one of the most successful online game develeopment educational groups out there.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo.


## In This Section

Get to grips with 3D and local multiplayer while we make a simple, fast and fun physics based local multiplayer sportsing* game.

"Sportsing" may not be a real word.

## How To Build / Compile
This is a Godot project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents and place them in your projects folder, then import the project in Godot's launcher.

This branch is the course branch, each commit corresponds to a lecture in the course. The current state is our latest progress.
